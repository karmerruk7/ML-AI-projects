## üöÄ Project Overview

**Diabetes Detection** is a supervised classification project focused on predicting diabetes risk based on variables such as:

- Glucose levels
- BMI
- Age
- Blood pressure
- Family history and lifestyle factors

By applying machine learning algorithms to structured data, the project aims to:

- Identify key predictors of diabetes
- Build accurate and interpretable models
- Support data-driven clinical decisions

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on patient health records to uncover trends and relationships  
- Develop and evaluate **classification models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Apply **feature selection**, **hyperparameter tuning**, and **class imbalance techniques** to optimize performance  
- Package and **deploy the final model** for real-time or batch predictions via a cloud platform

## üîÅ Workflow

### üîπ **Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Data Integrity Check**
  - Load dataset, verify column types, check for missing or duplicated records
  - Remove or correct invalid values (e.g., zero BMI or glucose)

- **Feature Exploration & Distribution Analysis**
  - Analyze key features: glucose, insulin, BMI, age, and blood pressure
  - Visualize distributions with histograms, boxplots, and pairplots

- **Class Imbalance & Correlation Analysis**
  - Check for imbalance in target variable (diabetic vs. non-diabetic)
  - Use correlation matrices or mutual information to rank feature importance

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Create derived features (e.g., BMI category, age bins, glucose/BMI ratios)
  - Normalize or standardize numerical values if required

- **Visualization**
  - Explore data structure and separability using:
    - Heatmaps
    - Violin plots
    - Dimensionality reduction: UMAP, t-SNE, PCA

---

### üîπ **Phase 2: Model Development**

- **Baseline & Classical Models**
  - Train initial models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
  - Use stratified train-test splits or k-fold cross-validation

- **Advanced Models**
  - Implement XGBoost, LightGBM, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Address imbalance using:
    - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
    - Undersampling
    - Class weights

- **Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning**
  - Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` for tuning
  - Evaluate using classification metrics:
    - **Precision**
    - **Recall**
    - **F1-Score**
    - **PR-AUC** (Precision-Recall Area Under Curve)

---

## üìå Key Tools & Libraries

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow/keras  
- **Environments:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab  

---

## üß† Next Steps

- Add model explainability (e.g., SHAP, LIME)
- Build Streamlit app for interactive diabetes risk prediction
- Deploy via AWS or Hugging Face Spaces
