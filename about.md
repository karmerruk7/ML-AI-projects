# About Me

I'm a data science enthusiast exploring applications of ML in energy, infrastructure, and sustainability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Currently Focused On

- **Time Series Forecasting**
  - Multivariate forecasting with environmental and operational data
  - Feature engineering: lag variables, rolling statistics, cyclical encodings
  - Classical and neural models: SARIMAX, XGBoost, LSTM

- **Deep Learning**
  - MLPs for tabular and structured data
  - LSTM & GRU for temporal sequence modeling
  - 1D CNNs for time series feature extraction and classification

- **Supervised Classification**
  - Binary classification tasks (e.g., diabetes detection)
  - Class imbalance handling: SMOTE, undersampling, class weights
  - Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC
  - Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP (Keras)
